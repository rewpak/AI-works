        "The map coloring problem involves assigning colors to different regions of a map in such a way that no adjacent regions have the same color.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoding scheme: we can use a list of 11 items, matching the number of names, and randomly give each a value from 0 to 3 for the four colors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fitness Function: Evaluate each map's coloring quality, penalizing adjacent same-colored regions or excessive color use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genetic operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Selection: Those with higher fitness (i.e., better map colorings) have a higher chance of being chosen.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Crossover: It involves swapping parts of two chromosomes - for map coloring, this means swapping color assignments between two regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Mutation: Occasionally, the algorithm introduces random changes to the chromosomes. For instance, it randomly changes the color assigned to a region.\n",
