        "The problem can be described as follows. Behind three closed doors, there is a car (the prize) and two goats (worthless). You pick a door, say No. 1. Then the host (Monty Hall in the show), who knows what are behind the doors, opens another door that has a goat, say No. 3. Now you have the chance to decide to stick to your original choice of No. 1 or to switch to No. 2.\n",
