        "We are given a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles from 1 to 8 and blank space. The tiles are randomly arranged. The aim of this puzzle is to rearange the numbered tiles with the minimal number of movements, so they are in numerically order and the gap at the end.\n",

        "The formalution of 8-puzzle is follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **State**: The state of a numbered tile shows where it is on a 3x3 grid with numbers 1-8 and 'E' for the empty space. We represent this with dashes in a single string to see what the puzzle looks like at any point.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Action**: It is sipmler to move the blabk tile in the four direction: up, down, left, right. we also need to check the boundary conditions to decide which of the four moves are valid for a given state.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Goal test**: We want to check if the current arrangement matches the final goal state of \"E-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Path Cost**: The cost is the count of moves it takes to solve the puzzle. Each step is one move.\n",
