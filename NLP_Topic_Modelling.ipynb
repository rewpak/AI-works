        "Topic modeling is a method used in text mining to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. The method involves the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Collection: Gather and compile the text data from various sources, such as articles, books, social media posts, or any other text-rich documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Preprocessing: We then perform a simple data cleaning by removing the stop words and stemming with one of the stemmers provided in nltk, “SnoballStemmer”\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Feature Extraction: Transform the preprocessed text into a format that can be analyzed and build a document-term matrix using the bag-of-words (BoW) model.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Model Selection: Choose a topic modeling algorithm. The most common ones are Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Training the Model: Run the chosen algorithm on your document-term matrix. The model will attempt to discover patterns and group words into topics based on their distribution across the documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Topic Interpretation: Analyze the output of the model, which includes a list of topics and the words that are most representative of each topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Application: Apply the trained LDA model to a new text."
